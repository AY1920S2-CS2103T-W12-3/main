== About us

=== About Sharkie

*Sharkie* is an all-in-one desktop application for personal finance tracking designed for university students who
would like to monitor their spending. It manages your incomes and expenses,
organises your contacts and keeps track of <<debt, debts>> your friends owe you, so that your <<loan, loans>> always
come with a money-back guarantee!

*Sharkie* is adapted from the https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[AddressBook-Level3] project created by SE-EDU
and is further developed into a finance tracking application by our awesome <<AboutUs#, developer team>>!


=== About This Guide

This developer guide is written for anyone who wish to build on our application, *Sharkie*,
or wish to know find out more about how *Sharkie* is implemented.

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Sharkie. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `people delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `people delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width=600]

The sections below give more details of each component.

//end::architecture[]

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SharkieParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("people delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

NOTE: The lifeline for `PeopleDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

//tag::model-design[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width=750]

.In-depth structure of the Model Manager
image::ModelManagerClassDiagram.png[width=800]

NOTE: The `ModelManager` class diagram is drawn separately as it is too complicated to include all the details in the
Model component diagram.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the <<wallet, Wallet>> data.
* stores the <<address-book, Address Book>> data.
* stores the User data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<<<transaction,Transaction>`>> that can be
'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the
respective lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `Wallet`,

* consists of a `BudgetList`.
* consists of a `TransactionList`, which contains `Income`(s) and a `TransactionList` which contains `Expense`(s).

The `AddressBook`,

* consists of a `UniquePersonList`.

The `UserData`,

* consists of a `User`.

====
The _Model_ package consists of four main packages: _Person_, _Transaction_,
_Reminder_ and _Tag_.

.In-depth structure of Person package in the Model Component
image::ModelPersonDiagram.png[width=900]

The diagram above shows how the _Person_ package is implemented:

* `PeoplePredicate`: `PeopleNamePredicate`, `PeoplePhonePredicate`, `PeopleTagPredicate`, `PeopleEmailPredicate`
are implemented for the execution of `people find` command.
* A `User` consists of a `Name`, a `Phone` and an `Email`.
* A `Person` consists of a `Name`, a `Phone`, an `Email`, a `TransactionList` of `Debt`(s),
a `TransactionList` of `Loan`(s) and a set of `Tag`(s).

.In-depth structure of Transaction package in the Model Component
image::ModelTransactionDiagram.png[width=1200]
.Transaction class diagram
image::ModelTransactionClassDiagram.png[width=400]

NOTE: The association between `Transaction` and `Amount` is not shown in _Figure 10_ to keep the diagram less messy.
However, the association is shown in _Figure 11_.

The diagram above shows how the _Transaction_ package is implemented:

* `WalletPredicate`: `DateContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `AmountContainsKeywordsPredicate`
are implemented for the execution of `wallet find` command.
* The abstract class `Transaction` is extended by `Income`, `Expense`, `Debt` and `Loan`. A `Transaction` consists of
a `Description`, an `Amount`, a `Date` and a `Tag`.
* A `Budget` consists of a `Year`, a `Month` and an `Amount`.

.Reminder class diagram
image::ModelReminderClassDiagram.png[width=400]

The _Reminder_ package is implemented for *Sharkie*'s reminder feature.

* The `Reminder` consists of a `User` (sender) and a `Person` (receiver).
* The `ConfirmationEmail` consists of a `Name` (user's name) and an `Email` (user's email).
** The `ConfirmationEmail` is implemented to confirm the user's email address during user's first login to *Sharkie*.

The _Tag_ package only consist of a class, `Tag` and it does not depends on other components in the Model.

====

//end::model-design[]

//tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The Storage converts Model objects to saveable data and vice versa. It comprises four main parts: `UserPrefsStorage`, `UserDataStorage`, `AddressBookStorage` and `WalletStorage`. Each of these interfaces have a JSON-based implementation that convert their specific data to and from JSON.

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save UserData in JSON format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in JSON format and read it back.
* can save the Wallet data in JSON format and read it back.
//end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::owe[]
=== People Owe Command

The `people owe` command is implemented in the class `PeopleOweCommand`.

This command can be accessed from  `Logic#execute()`. It records a `debt` of an indicated `Amount` to the
`Person` specified by the index.

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when the user enters a `people owe` command:

.Activity diagram of the recording a debt
image::OweActivityDiagram.png[width=500]

==== Implementation of `people owe` command

. When entering the debt command, the user will specify the `Person` using the index of the `Person` in the list shown in the GUI.
. The user should also specify the debt `Description`, `Amount` and optionally, the `Date`.
. The `PeopleOweCommandParser` will create a `Debt` object based on the details provided, and return the resulting `PeopleOweCommand`.
. When the `LogicManager` is executing the `PeopleOweCommand`, it will extract the indicated person from the list of
`Persons` obtained from the `Model` via `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`
. A new `Person` with the added `Debt` is created.
. This new `Person` replace the initial `Person` at the indicated index via `Model#setPerson()` for immutability.
. The `filteredPersons` in the `Model` is then updated.
. `CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens during the execution of a `people owe` command:

image::OweSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Sequence diagram of the `people owe` command
image::GetPeopleOweCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=500]

NOTE: The lifeline for `PeopleOweCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Keeping track of `Debt` of a `Person`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each `Person` has a list of `Debt` objects, each `Debt` object
has `Description`, `Amount` and `Date`.
** Pros: Able to record more information about a `Debt`.
** Cons: `Sharkie` only allows the return of a `Debt` all at once, i.e., the user cannot return a `Debt` partially.
* **Alternative 2:** Each `Person` has one `Debt` object.
** Pros: Easier to store the `Debt` object, only have to keep track of the total debt `Amount` and the `Date` of the
debt. The user can return any `Amount` to the `Person`, and `Sharkie` will just deduct the total `Amount` of debt
accordingly.
** Cons: Storing the `Date` is problematic, as it questions whether the `Date` of the first borrowing or latest borrowing
should be stored. Furthermore, there is no breakdown of `Debt` details if the user wants to recall why he owed a `Person`
money.

//end::owe[]

// tag::received_implementation[]
=== People Received Command

The `people received` command is implemented in the class, `PeopleReceivedCommand`.

This command can be accessed from `Logic#execute()`. It deletes the `Loan`(s) of the indicated `Person`
(the `Person` with the specified index in the Address Book).

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when the user executes a `people received` command:

.Activity diagram of recording the amount of money received
image::ReceivedActivityDiagram.png[width=800]

==== Implementation of `people received` command

. In `PeopleReceivedCommand` class, the list of `Persons` is obtained from the `Model` via
`Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and the indicated person is extracted from the list.
. The list of `Loans` of the `Person` is extracted and modified based on the command entered by the user.
. A new `Person` with the modified list of `Loans` is created.
. This new `Person` replace the initial `Person` at the indicated index via `Model#setPerson()` and the `filteredPersons`
in the `Model` is updated.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens during the execution of a `people received` command:

image::ReceivedSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Sequence diagram of the `people received` command
image::GetPeopleReceivedCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width = 600]

NOTE: The lifeline for `PeopleReceivedCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Deletion of `Loan` from the indicated person.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new `Person` with the modified list of `Loans` and
use `Model#setPerson()` to replace the indicated `Person` with the new `Person` created.
** Pros: Preserve the immutable property of `Person`.
** Cons: Have to copy over all the attribute values, such as `Name`, `Phone` and more.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify the list of `Loans` in the indicated `Person` directly.
** Pros: Easier and can save time from copying the information from one `Person` to another.
** Cons: `Person` loses the immutable property.

// end::received_implementation[]

//tag::transactions[]
=== Transactions

The `Transaction` forms the basis for Sharkie's monetary-related features. It contains a `Description`, `Amount`, `Date` and `Tag`.

There are currently four classes that inherit from this abstract class, namely `Expense`, `Income`, `Debt` and `Loan`.

.Class diagram of Transaction
image::TransactionClassDiagram.png[width=500]

`Expense` and `Income` can be created using the `WalletExpenseCommand` and the `WalletIncomeCommand`.

These commands can be accessed from  `Logic#execute()`. It records an `expense` of an indicated `Description`, `Amount`, `Date` and `Tag`.

As the two commands are similar, it is sufficient to trace the `WalletExpenseCommand`. The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when the user enters a `wallet expense` command:

.Activity diagram of recording an expense
image::ExpenseActivityDiagram.png[width=500]

==== Implementation of `wallet expense` command

. When entering the expense command, the user will specify the `Description`, `Amount` and optionally, the `Date` and `Tag`.
. The `WalletExpenseCommandParser` will create an `Expense` object based on the details provided, and return the resulting `WalletExpenseCommand`.
. The `LogicManager` then executes the command and adds the previously created `Expense` object to the Wallet model.
. `CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens during the execution of a `wallet expense` command:

.Sequence diagram of the `wallet expense` command
image::ExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `WalletExpenseCommandParser` and `WalletExpenseCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storing the Amount of a Transaction.

* **Alternative 1 (previous implementation):** Amounts are stored in dollars as `double`.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Floats are inexact. Floating point errors may cause rounding errors or unexpected bugs(e.g. checking if an amount is equal to zero).
* **Alternative 2 (current implementation):** Amounts are stored in cents as `long`.
** Pros: Arithmetic involving amounts will be exact.
** Cons: Conversion is needed between cents and dollars. All Sharkie programmers have to be aware of the necessary conversion else bugs may occur.
* **Alternative 3:** Amounts are stored as the inbuilt `BigDecimal` class.
** Pros: Arithmetic involving amounts will be exact.
** Cons: `BigDecimal` is slower in performance and if many calculations are performed, runtime is considerably slower.

//end::transactions[]

// tag::walletEdit_implementation[]
=== Wallet Edit Command

The `edit` command is implemented in the class, `WalletEditCommand`.

This command can be accessed from `Logic#execute()`. It edits the `transactions`(s), which include both `income`(s) and
`expense`(s) of the indicated `transaction` (the `transaction` with the specified index in the Wallet).

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when the user executes a `wallet edit` command:

.Activity diagram of the editing a transaction
image::WalletEditActivityDiagram.png[width=600]

==== Implementation of `wallet edit` command

. `WalletEditCommandParser` is executed first to create an `EditTransactorDescriptor` to hold the values to be edited.
. `WalletEditCommandParser` then passes the `editTransactorDescriptor` to create a `WalletEditCommand`.
. In `WalletEditCommand` class, the list of `transactions` is obtained from the `Model` via
`Model#getFilteredTransactionsList()` and the indicated transaction is extracted from the list, as either a form of
income or expense.
. The `transaction` selected is extracted and modified based on the command entered by the user, which are stored in
`editTransactorDescriptor`
. A new `transaction` modified from the `transaction` selected is created with `createEditedTransaction` method in
`WalletEditCOmmand`
. This new `transaction` replace the initial `transaction` at the indicated index via `Model#setTransaction()` and
the `filteredTransactions` in the `Model` is updated.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens during the execution of a `wallet edit` command:

.Sequence diagram of the `wallet edit` command
image::WalletEditSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `WalletEditCommand`, `WalletEditCommandParser` and `EditTransactorDescriptor` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Choosing which `transaction` to edit from the list of transactions.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Get the index from the list displayed, and not original index displayed by
`wallet list command`.
** Pros: Easy to see which `transaction` is to be edited.
** Cons: Have to keep updating the filtered list.
* **Alternative 2:** Always edit based on original list, shown by `wallet list command`.
** Pros: Index is always consistent.
** Cons: Harder to remember which index represents which transaction.

// end::walletEdit_implementation[]

// tag::walletBudget_implementation[]
=== Wallet Budget Command
The `budget` command is implemented in the class, `WalletBudgetCommand`.

This command can be accessed from `Logic#execute()`. It adds a budget using the parameters as specified by the user.

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when a user executes the `wallet budget` command:

.Activity diagram of the execution of `wallet budget` command
image::WalletBudgetActivityDiagram.png[width=600]

==== Implementation of `wallet budget` command

. In `WalletBudgetCommand` class, the `Budget` produced by `WalletBudgetCommandParser` is examined to determine if it is a default budget, or if it is a normal budget.
.. If the `Budget` is a default budget, the `BudgetList` is updated in the `Model` via `Model#setDefaultBudget()`. This sets the default budget as the one given.
.. If the `Budget` is not a default budget, the `BudgetList` is updated in the `Model` via `Model#setBudget()`. This adds the budget given to a list of budgets with their `Month` and `Year` specified.
. The list of `Budget` in the `Wallet` is modified based the arguments input by the user.
. If a `Budget` with the same arguments given already exists, it will be overwritten by the one given.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens during the execution of a `wallet budget` command:

.Sequence diagram of the `wallet budget` command
image::WalletBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Selection of `Budget` to set: default or specific month / year

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** If the month and year of the budget is specified, the specific `Budget` will be set. Otherwise, the default `Budget` will be set.
** Pros: Easy to differentiate during command processing whether we want a default `Budget` or a specific one.
** Cons: All `Budget` except default `Budget` all contain a redundant `isDefault` boolean
* **Alternative 2:** Allow the user to specify if they want a default `Budget` set, or a specific `Budget` instead.
** Pros: Clearer way to distinguish between default `Budget` and specific `Budget`
** Cons: Requires more prefixes / suffixes to be added to `Parser` in order to parse extra arguments.

// end::walletBudget_implementation[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
