== PROJECT: Sharkie

---

== Overview

Sharkie is a desktop expense tracker application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented the model layer for Wallet, Income, Expense.
** What it does: creates the in-memory objects that are required for monetary tracking.
// ** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
// ** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: adapted from existing AddressBook code.

// * *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
