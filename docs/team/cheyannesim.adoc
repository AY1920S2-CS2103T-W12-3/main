== PROJECT: Sharkie

---

== Overview

Sharkie is a desktop expense tracker application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancements*: added *owe command*
** Added People's command, `owe`
*** What it does: allows the user to keep track of what they owe to other people in the addressbook.
*** Justification: This is one of the main feature of Sharkie.
*** Highlights: The implementation was quite challenging as it required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. For instance, how to store the Transactions,
since a Transaction has association to Description, Amount, Date and Tag, and Date itself have different formats to consider. I have implemented the logic, model,
storage and ui for this command.
** Added People's command, `returned`
*** What it does: allows the user to record that he/she has already returned the debt(s).
** Modified People's command, `find`
*** What it does: allows the user to find people based on their name, phone, email or tags.
I have also added the the tags "Debt" and "Loan" to people whom the user owes and lends, so that the user
can filter the people whom they lend or owe using the command `people find t/debt loan`.

* *Other contributions*:
** Documentation:
*** Updated my part of my User Guide: (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-3/main/pull/43[#43])
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-3/main/pull/95[#95],

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
