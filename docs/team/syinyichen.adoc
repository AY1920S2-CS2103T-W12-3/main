== PROJECT: Sharkie

---

== Overview

*Sharkie* is a desktop expense tracker application. The user interacts with it using a CLI,
and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:

** *Added* `*lend*` *command* (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-3/main/pulls[#87])
*** What it does: Allows the user to record the amount of money lent to other people in the address book.
*** Justification: This is one of the key features of Sharkie, which records the flow of money between the user and
the people in the address book.
*** Highlights: This command involves both `Transactions` and `Person` models, considerations have to made on how to
use both of the models without changing their purposes or properties.
** *Added* `*received*` *command* (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-3/main/pulls[#98])
*** What it does: Allows the user to record that a person, who the user lent to has returned the amount of money.
*** Justification: This is an essential update, which allows the user to remove the `loans` recorded by the
`lend` command.
*** Highlights: Considerations were needed during the implementation of this feature, to preserve the immutable
property of `Person`.
** *Added user data storage* (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-3/main/pulls[#95])
*** What it does: Stores user data, such as name, phone and e-mail address.
*** Justification: The storage of user data is important, as the user details are required to use the `remind`
and `remindall` commands.
*** Highlights: This update was challenging, an entire new storage need to be built to store the user data, as the
data needed to be stored differs from those in address book.
** *Added* `*remind*` *and* `*remindall*` *command* (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-3/main/pulls[#95])
*** What it does: Allows the user to send reminders to the people, who has yet return the amount of money they lent via email.
*** Justification: This is one of the main features of Sharkie, which allows the interaction between the user and
the people in the address book.
*** Highlights: The implementation of this feature was new to me, as it involves the usage of the internet and the
connection to e-mail servers.
*** Credits: _javax.mail_ is used in the implementation of this feature.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Make Sharkie sends a confirmation email to user to validate the user's email address during user's first login. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-3/main/pulls[#249])

* *Other contributions*:
** Enhancements to existing features:
