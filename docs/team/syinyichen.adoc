== PROJECT: Sharkie

---

== Overview

*Sharkie* is a desktop expense tracker application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands* *[to be edited]*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement* *[to be edited]*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
