== Introduction

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, AB3 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Commands
*Sharkie* uses a simple syntax to function that will be explained here. *Sharkie* is filled with many different commands
that can get complicated, so we have segregated it into two parts:
`people` commands and `wallet` commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in angle brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `$/<amount> [d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy>]` can be used as `$/5 d/21/02/2020` or as `$/5`.
* `people` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “People” tab, for instance:
`people add n/<name> p/<phone number> e/<email address>`
* `wallet` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “Wallet” tab, for instance:
`wallet expense n/<item> d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy> $/<price>`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone number>`, `p/<phone number> n/<name>` is also acceptable.
