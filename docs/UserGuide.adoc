== Introduction

Welcome to *Sharkie*!

*Sharkie* is an all-in-one desktop application for *personal finance tracking* designed for university students who would like to monitor their spending.
It manages your *incomes and expenses*, organises your *contacts* and keeps track of *debts* your friends owe you, so that your loans always come with a money-back guarantee!

*Sharkie* boasts a sleek, trendy Graphical User Interface (GUI) while being at its core a *Command Line Application* - this means that the faster you type, the faster you can get those pesky finances out of your head and into Sharkie's management system.

[[Commands]]
== Commands
//tag::commandintro[]
*Sharkie* uses a simple syntax to function that will be explained here. *Sharkie* is filled with many different commands that can get complicated, so we have segregated it into two parts:
`people` commands and `wallet` commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in angle brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `$/<amount> [d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy>]` can be used as `$/5 d/21/02/2020` or as `$/5`.
* `people` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “People” tab, for instance:
`people add n/<name> p/<phone number> e/<email address>`
* `wallet` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “Wallet” tab, for instance:
`wallet expense n/<item> d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy> $/<price>`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone number>`, `p/<phone number> n/<name>` is also acceptable.

[[valid-amount]]
*Q*: Is there a maximum amount of money that Sharkie can handle? +
*A*: Yes. Due to program limitations, Sharkie can only safely handle amounts of up to $92233720368547758.07 (about ninety *quadrillion* dollars!). We believe it is safe to say that the average user will not end up spending or earning that amount of money anytime soon (at time of writing, Jeff Bezos' net worth is roughly $100 billion).
