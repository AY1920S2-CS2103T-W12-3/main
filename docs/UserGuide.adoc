[[Commands]]
== Commands
//tag::commandintro[]
*Sharkie* uses a simple syntax to function that will be explained here. *Sharkie* is filled with many different commands that can get complicated, so we have segregated them into two parts:
`people` commands and `wallet` commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in angle brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `$/<amount> [d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy>]` can be used as `$/5 d/21/02/2020` or as `$/5`.
* `people` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “People” tab, for instance:
`people add n/<name> p/<phone number> e/<email address>`
* `wallet` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “Wallet” tab, for instance:
`wallet expense n/<item> $/<price>  [d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy>] [t/<tag>]`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone number>`, `p/<phone number> n/<name>` is also acceptable.

==== Finding a person: `find`

Suppose you want to find a person in your contact list by a specific keyword,
the command you would enter is our `people find` command.

*Format*: `people find n/<keyword> [<keyword>...]`
or `people find p/<keyword> [<keyword>...]`
or `people find e/<keyword> [<keyword>...]`
or `people find t/<keyword> [<keyword>...]`

====
*Command Format*

The following are the restrictions of `people find` command, which you would need to take note of:

* You would not have to consider the case of the `<keyword>`, as it is case-insensitive.
* The `<keyword>` you want to enter need not to be in full. For example, `people find n/jo` will display the
persons whose name contains with the keyword `jo`, such as `Joel`.
* The `<keyword>` you entered should be either of the type name (`n/`), phone (`p/`), email (`p/`) or tag (`t/`).
** You may use the tag prefix `t/` to find people with debts or loans in your address book.
Hence, `Debt` and `Loan` (case-insensitive) are the only tags, which you are allowed to use in `people find` command.
====

NOTE: `Loans` represent the amount of money you lend your friends and `debts` represent the amount of money you owe
your friends. +

** The command you would enter is `people find t/debt loan`.
** This requests *Sharkie* to list out the people with unsettled debt(s) or loan(s).

*Expected Outcome #2*:

    2 persons listed!

*A*: Yes. Due to program limitations, Sharkie can only safely handle amounts of up to $92233720368547758.07 (about ninety *quadrillion* dollars!).

*Q*: Why does my `people remind` and `people remindall` commands take time to run? +

time is needed for the application to send a reminder.

*A*: You may need to check your junk mail folder, as your e-mail account may categorize *Sharkie*'s e-mails as spam.
If you wish to receive frequent notifications from *Sharkie*, please remove *Sharkie* from your junk mail list.
