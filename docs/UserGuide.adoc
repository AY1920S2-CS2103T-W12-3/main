== Introduction

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, AB3 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Commands
*Sharkie* uses a simple syntax to function that will be explained here. *Sharkie* is filled with many different commands that can get complicated, so we have segregated it into two parts:
`people` commands and `wallet` commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in angle brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `$/<amount> [d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy>]` can be used as `$/5 d/21/02/2020` or as `$/5`.
* `people` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “People” tab, for instance:
`people add n/<name> p/<phone number> e/<email address>`
* `wallet` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “Wallet” tab, for instance:
`wallet expense n/<item> d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy> $/<price>`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone number>`, `p/<phone number> n/<name>` is also acceptable.
