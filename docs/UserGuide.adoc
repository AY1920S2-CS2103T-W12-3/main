[[Commands]]
== Commands
//tag::commandintro[]
*Sharkie* uses a simple syntax to function that will be explained here. *Sharkie* is filled with many different commands that can get complicated, so we have segregated it into two parts:
`people` commands and `wallet` commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in angle brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `$/<amount> [d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy>]` can be used as `$/5 d/21/02/2020` or as `$/5`.
* `people` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “People” tab, for instance:
`people add n/<name> p/<phone number> e/<email address>`
* `wallet` commands are used when you want to do things related to the “Wallet” tab, for instance:
`wallet expense n/<item> d/<date:dd/mm/yyyy> $/<price>`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone number>`, `p/<phone number> n/<name>` is also acceptable.

*Q*: What is a `debt's index` or a `loan's index`? +
*A*: A `debt's index` is the index number shown in a person's displayed debts list, whereas a `loan's index` is the
index number shown in a person's displayed loans list. A `debt's index` indicates a specific debt of a person and a
`loan's index` indicated a specific loan of a person.

****
For example,

* The `debt's index` of the debt, `Dinner | $12.00 | 1 APR 2020`, under Bernice Yu is `1`.
* The `loan's index` of the loan, `Movie | $10.00 | 2 FEB 2020`, under Bernice Yu is `1`.

*Q*: Is there a maximum amount of money that Sharkie can handle? +
*A*: Yes. Due to program limitations, Sharkie can only safely handle amounts of up to $92233720368547758.07 (about ninety *quadrillion* dollars!). We believe it is safe to say that the average user will not end up spending or earning that amount of money anytime soon (at time of writing, Jeff Bezos' net worth is roughly $100 billion).
